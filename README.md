## ðŸ“– Rules Reference

- **0 Stamina**: fighter suffers âˆ’2 to all rolls until stamina is recovered.
- **Defense**: successful block restores +1 Stamina.
- **Counters**: trigger on +3 margin; Perfect Counter on +5 (+1 dmg).
- **Criticals**:
  - PvP contested = margin +5
  - Solo rolls = Nat 12 (crit) / Nat 2 (crit fail)
- **Move + Attack** allowed in the same Tempo (pay stamina for both).
- **Attack Actions** consume the **full minute**.  
- **Non-Attack Actions** (Taunt, Move, IQ, Recover) consume **one Tempo**, not the full minute.
